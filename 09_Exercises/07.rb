# Functionally, arrays have numeric indices which correspond to the values of its content, while hashes have keys.
# Structurally, arrays store their contents in adjacent memory space with O(1) lookup, and O(n) search time complexity.
# Hashes use hash tables, which "hash" keys to an array index, which allows for (amortized) O(1) lookup and O(1).
